# Rice_Image_Classification

I have classify the image using deep learning 
As the dataset is very large to run on my pc so I have tried using all types of techniques.
Without using transfer learning techniques my accuracy was low as compared to using VGG16 algorithm.
As i am not able to run all the epoch due to the computational time I have just checked with one epoch and my accuracy is better by using VGG16 algorithm.

I have share both the codes.
